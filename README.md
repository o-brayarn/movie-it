## Description

MovieIt is an opensource that collects user reviews and displays them on the page to help end users know if a movie or television show will be worth their time. It also collects user's latest movie suggestions so that the movie vendor can add it to his/her repository. MovieIt can be thought of as an interface that the movie vendors(or movie shops) and users can get to know what others think about a movie, and contribute to the list of available movies.
